    <p>Hi there! As you can probably tell from the look of this page, I am attempting to become a game journalist - and what better way than to start by describing the best games I can remember since childhood.
    I've been around a computer frequently since the age of 6, and during the time from then to now I've played a plenty of games. Mostly I am a huge fan of the RPG genre, be it a cRPG, ARPG, MMORPG and so forth.
    From the ratings it might seem like I am biased, but hey - who doesn't like these games is probably a prick or hasn't tried 'em.</p>
    <p>In any case, enjoy the list (or better yet, enjoy the games!), and if you have any more questions, please head <a href="https://taltech.ee">to this location.</a></p>

            on the PC; osu! is a more modern game designed to be played with a mouse/tablet and a keyboard.</td>
